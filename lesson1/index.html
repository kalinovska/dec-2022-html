<h2><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Homer_Simpson">Homer Simpson</a></h2>
<p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956 or 1969 or 1975 or 1983)[40] is a man from Springfield. He is the spouse of
    Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be 239 pounds)[41], lazy,
    and often ignorant to the world around him. Although he has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love,
    and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't.

    His favorite color is blue, and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, drinking, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade racer,
    playing the piano and horse riding. His favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride the
    Champion Mechanical Horse".

    Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is
    often incompetent and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his
    friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found sitting on the
    couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff.</p>
